ActivityDesc
	Numbers have been replaced with the descriptive names contained above in "Activity"

Column Names:
	colnames.txt  contains all measurement descriptions that correspond to: 
		Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration
		Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope
		There are a total of 561-features with time and frequency domain variables
		BodyAcc = body acceleration
		GravityAcc = acceleration due to gravity
		Jerk: rate at which acceleration changes with respect to time
		Gyro: from the gyroscope
		Mag: Magnitude
		f: fraction?
		angle: angle between two directional vectors
		X,Y,Z correspond to the three directions of motion 
		mean() = column contains averages
		std()  = column contains standard deviations
		mad() = column contains	Median Absolute Deviation
		max() = column contains maximum values
		min() = column contains minimum values
		sma() = column contains moving averages
		energy() = column contains energy values
		iqr() = column contains interquartile range
		entropy() = column contains entropy values
		arCoeff() = column contains autoregression coefficients
		correlation() = column contains cross correlations between the measurements in the indicated directions 

	
	TidyDataNames.txt: contains the Subject numbers, Activity descriptions, and subset of measurements that correspond to means and standard deviations (88 columns total)
